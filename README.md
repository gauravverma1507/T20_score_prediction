========T20 SCORE PREDICTOR(Machine Learning)========  
A very warm welcome to you all guys. 
Here you all will learn how i maded a T-20 score predictor with the help of machine learning. 
As you all know machine learning is trending all over the world where you can built huge number of models with the use of python.  
T-20 world cup matches are popular among all international level where you can predict the score that can be maded by each team , it is as easy as guessing the score after the first 5 overs or recent 5 overs.
This score is displayed among all matches in the tv chanells  where persons can predict this team will score for like 160 or any number , it is simply based on the current performance of the team. 
This may help cricketors for the new strategy to improve their performance and much more This predictor model can by maded using popular machine learning algorithm : RANDOM FOREST &amp; using XG-Boost. 
Here you will also understand how to deal with yaml files(YAML is a data serialization language that is often used for writing configuration files).
This model tends accuracy of 98%.  You can easily make model by simply training the model with the dataset of previous performance of cricketors. 
This model is very easy to use as it is web deployed on Heroku using StreamLit
